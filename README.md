### Why R pre-meetings and Conference

The Why R Foundation is a European R user community foundation.
They are running a series of pre-meetings around Europe in anticipation of their [main conference](https://whyr.pl/2020/) in Warsaw in August 2020.

The Irish events would be part of that series. We are planning to develop something similar in Ireland.

As an aside, Why R was bidding to host UseR! 2021 in Warsaw, and were in the shortlist of the final three candidates. 


### African Events

Why R are also financially supporting a series of events in Africa over the spring.
* a SatRdays conference in both Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) and Johannesburg (South Africa)
* A series of Forwards workshops in eSwatini, Namibia and Bostswana.

The profits from the main conference are not massive, so the contributions are rather modest (approx 300 Euro per event).
It provides clarity as to what exactly an organization is essentially supporting, if they support Why R in any way.


### Forwards

Forwards are running a fundraiser to raise the rest of the funds for their workshops.
More details be found here: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/forwards-southern-africa-project-2020#

Forwards s the R Foundation taskforce for underrepresented groups, and is lead by Dr Heather Turner, Prof Julie Josse, and Prof. Dianne Cook.
